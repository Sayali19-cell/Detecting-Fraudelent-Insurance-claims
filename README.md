Detecting Fraudulent Insurance Claims with an Integrated UI/UX Approach
In the ever-evolving world of insurance, swiftly and accurately identifying fraudulent claims is paramount. Our client, a leading motor vehicle insurance provider, faced the challenge of distinguishing between genuine and deceptive claims. To tackle this, we developed a comprehensive solution that combined a robust backend model with an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
Understanding the Challenge
Insurance fraud is a persistent issue, with many policyholders attempting to claim coverage for damages not included in their policies by fabricating evidence. Our task was to create an application capable of accurately flagging these fraudulent claims for further inspection while ensuring that genuine claims could be processed seamlessly.
Data Collection and Validation
The project began with thorough discussions to define the data requirements. Leading this effort, I ensured that we gathered detailed datasets from the client, focusing on motor vehicle insurance policies and claims data. Once collected, rigorous validation processes were applied to ensure data integrity, segregating non-compliant data into a "bad data" folder and preserving clean data in a "good data" folder.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
EDA involved a deep dive into the dataset, identifying missing values, outliers, and correlations. Key insights included managing imbalanced data in the 'Fraud Reported' column, which required careful handling to improve model performance. Subsequent feature engineering refined the data, with missing values imputed and categorical variables encoded appropriately.
Model Selection and Optimization
Given the classification nature of the problem, we experimented with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. After standardizing the data and applying hyperparameter tuning, the Decision Tree emerged as the best performer with an accuracy of 87%.
UI/UX Integration
A powerful backend model was just one part of the solution. Equally important was the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). We designed a clean, intuitive dashboard that allowed insurance agents to interact with the system effortlessly. Key features included:
•	Dashboard: A summary of claims, highlighting those flagged as potentially fraudulent.
•	Claim Details: Detailed information for each claim, including the model's confidence score and key indicators influencing the decision.
•	Manual Review Workflow: Guided inspection processes for claims flagged as potentially fraudulent, ensuring accurate decision-making.
•	Feedback Loop: A mechanism for users to report incorrect predictions, which helped improve the model over time.
Deployment and Conclusion
The final step involved deploying the model via a Flask API and conducting rigorous testing with Postman. This ensured seamless functionality and integration with the UI, allowing quick and informed decision-making. The project successfully combined data science with UI/UX design, resulting in a powerful tool that the client could rely on to detect fraudulent claims efficiently. The solution not only met but exceeded expectations, providing an integrated approach that balanced technical excellence with user-centric design.
